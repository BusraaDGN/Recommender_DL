Recommender Systems with Deep Learning

															SONG RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
									   							    «The Quest»

A music recommendation system has been developed with our team named “The Quest”. Suggestions were made with Deep Learning models instead of "Collaborative Filtering" which is one of the traditional methods. Models were developed on large volumes of data using the Million Song dataset. It provides the user with suggestions about the number of times the user has listened to the music he has listened to before, or the music that is likely to listen among the music he has never heard before, and how many times he can listen.

Our artificial intelligence-based music recommendation system tries to understand the music that the user likes, based on the music that the user listens. In this way, it recommends the music that the user does not listen to, but may be able to listen many times.
