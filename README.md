Recommender Systems with Deep Learning

A music recommendation system has been developed with our team named “The Quest”. Suggestions were made with Deep Learning models instead of "Collaborative Filtering" which is one of the traditional methods. Models were developed on large volumes of data using the Million Song dataset. It provides the user with suggestions about the number of times the user has listened to the music he has listened to before, or the music that is likely to listen among the music he has never heard before, and how many times he can listen.
